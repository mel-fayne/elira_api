- The table below shows the language distribution for the various Specialisations the system is predicting. It outlines the languages that ideally total upto 100% of the user's top 5 most used languages. 
- This criteria was chosen since the API being used to retrieve github details functions using this percentage method. The distribution was also done based off the technical skills(languages) most employers in the said specialisations seek in candidates.
- The columns will be filled with the student's language use percentage in comparison to their usage of the other top 4 langages. 
- The distribution is as follows:

| No. | Specialisation               | Abbreviation | Unit Groupings                    |
